# Trends in Atmospheric Concentrations of CO2
Time Series Analysis

Mauna Loa is the world’s largest active volcano which recently erupted "for the first time in four
decades". Researchers from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association
(NOAA), before their work was interrupted by this recent eruption of theMauna Loa volcano, were
stationed there to measure how the world’s atmospheric carbon dioxide has been changing over
time. With their research, they have been contributing to the research on climate change. CO2 as
one of the greenhouse gases is the primary driver of climate change. Studying how the CO2 level
has been changing over time helps us understand the severity of the issue of climate change. It is
equally important to be able to make predictions about how it will change in the future because
with that, we can raise awareness among the public and informpolicymakers about the issue so
that they can make policies that make it easy to apply preventative measures. With the aim to model
the atmospheric CO2 level utilizing the monthly data collected at theMauna Loa Observatory in
Hawaii, between 2000 and 2019, and make validation for the model about the CO2 level for the year
2020 with the 1 year ahead forecasting. Additionally, the 3-year ahead (2019-2022) forecast provides
a visual representation of atmospheric CO2 level in the hypothetical scenario where COVID-19 did
not occur, and we have continued to emit the same level of CO2. Forecast shows that unfortunately,
the CO2 level has continued to increase despite the pandemic forcing people to stay at home and
consequently not emit CO2 at the same rate as pre-pandemic.

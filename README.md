# Trends in Atmospheric Concentrations of CO2
Time Series Analysis

Mauna Loa, the world's largest active volcano, recently experienced its first eruption in four decades. Prior to this unexpected event, researchers from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) were stationed there, diligently tracking changes in the Earth's atmospheric carbon dioxide levels over time. Their work has been a significant contribution to the ongoing research on climate change.

Carbon dioxide (CO2), a prominent greenhouse gas, serves as a primary driver of climate change. The study of its historical trends helps us grasp the gravity of the climate change issue. Equally crucial is our ability to make predictions about future CO2 levels, as this knowledge enables us to raise public awareness and inform policymakers. In turn, informed policies can facilitate the implementation of preventive measures.

To achieve this goal, my aim is to develop a model for atmospheric CO2 levels using monthly data collected at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii between 2000 and 2019. Additionally, I sought to validate this model's accuracy by forecasting CO2 levels for the year 2020 with a one-year ahead prediction. Furthermore, a three-year ahead forecast (2019-2022) was created to visually depict the atmospheric CO2 levels in a hypothetical scenario where COVID-19 did not occur, and emissions continued at the same pre-pandemic rate. Unfortunately, the forecast demonstrates that CO2 levels have continued to rise, despite the pandemic's impact on reducing emissions due to people staying at home.
